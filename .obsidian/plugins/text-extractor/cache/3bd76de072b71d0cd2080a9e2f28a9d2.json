Every ﬁnite language is regular. 3. Every language in NP is decidable. 4. Language {0n1m : n ≤ m} is regular. 5. Language {w : number of 1s in w is divisible by 2024} is regular. 6. Language {⟨D⟩ : D is a DFA with L(D) = ∅} is in P. 7. Language {⟨G⟩ : G is a graph with vertex cover of size 2024} is NP-complete. 8. Suppose A ⊆ B ⊆ C where A and C are decidable. Then B is recognisable. 9. If A and B are recognisable, then A ∩ B is recognisable. 10. If A ≤m B, then A ≤p B. 11. If A ≤m B, then A ≤m B. 12. If L ∈ NP, then L ∈ NP. 13. P = NP ∩ coNP. 14. 3-SAT ≤m HALT. 15. 2-SAT ∈ P. For each statement, write down one of − T if the statement is known to be true. − F if the statement is false or not known to be true. E.g., both P = NP and P ̸= NP should be marked F. − or leave your answer empty. A correct T/F answer is worth +1 point, an incorrect answer is worth −1 point, and an empty answer is worth 0 points.

(Only the statement, not its proof !) 2b Let Σ = {a, b, c}. Show that the following language is regular: Double-Σ = { w ∈ Σ∗ : Every symbol in Σ appears in w at least twice }. 3 (15 pts) NP-completeness I. Show that the following language is NP-complete: DoubleSAT = { ⟨ϕ⟩ : ϕ is a CNF that has at least two satisfying assignments } . 4 (15 pts) NP-completeness II. Suppose S = {S1, . . . , Sn} is a family of subsets of {1, 2, . . . , n}. We say that k distinct sets Si1, . . . , Sik ∈ S form a packing of size k if the sets are pairwise disjoint, that is, Sij ∩ Sij′ = ∅ for j ̸= j′. Show that the following problem is NP-complete: SetPacking = { ⟨S, k⟩ : Family S contains a packing of size k } . 5 (20 pts) Undecidability. Consider the language DoubleTM = { ⟨M ⟩ : M is a TM that accepts at least two inputs, i.e., |L(M )| ≥ 2 } . Classify DoubleTM as one of (i) decidable, (ii) undecidable but recognisable, (iii) unrecognis- able. Justify your answer with a proof. (Note: You are not allowed to use Rice’s theorem as mentioned in Homework 2! Use only concepts introduced in class/exercises.) 6 (15 pts) Doubly accepting NFA. Let N be an NFA. The usual deﬁnition of acceptance is the existence of at least one accepting path. Change this deﬁnition as follows: N accepts the input word w iﬀ there are at least two accepting paths. Denote by L2(N ) the set of strings that admit at least two accepting paths. Prove that L2(N ) is regular.
