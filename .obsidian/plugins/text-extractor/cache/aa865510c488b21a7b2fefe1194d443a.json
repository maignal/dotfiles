Solve as many problems as you can and ask for help if you get stuck for too long. Problems marked * are more difficult but also more fun :). These problems are taken from various sources at EPFL and on the Internet, too numer- ous to cite individually. 1 Prove that the following problems are in NP: 1a A Boolean formula is said to be in disjunctive normal form (DNF) if it is an OR (∨) of a number of terms, where each term is an AND (∧) of some literals. For instance, the following is a DNF formula: (x ∧ y ∧ ¯z) ∨ (¯y ∧ z) ∨ (¯x ∧ ¯y). Given a DNF formula, decide it is satisfiable. 1b Given n positive integers a1, a2, . . . , an, decide if there is some S ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , n} with ∑ i∈S ai = ∑ i̸∈S ai. 2 Show that if L1, L2 ⊆ Σ∗ are in NP then their concatenation L = L1L2 is also in NP. 3 Prove that the following problem is NP-complete: Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) and a positive integer k, decide if there is a subset S of V with |S| ≥ k such that there is an edge between every pair of vertices in S? 4* Let 3SAT3 be the problem of deciding whether a 3CNF formula φ, with the additional assumption that every variable occurs at most 3 times in φ, is satisfiable. Show that 3SAT3 is NP-complete. Page 1 (of 1) CS-251 Theory of Computation • Spring 2025","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
