Solve as many problems as you can and ask for help if you get stuck for too long. Problems marked * are more difficult but also more fun :). These problems are taken from various sources at EPFL and on the Internet, too numer- ous to cite individually. 1 For both of the following languages over Σ = {0, 1}, construct an NFA which recognizes it. 1a {w | w has a 1 in the third to last position} 1b {w | w contains four consecutive symbols that are the same} 2 For both of the NFA over Σ = {0, 1} below, construct a DFA that accepts the same language. First, write down the subset construction and then remove any states that are not reachable. 2a q0 q1 0 0 1 1 2b q0 q1 q2 0 1 0 0 1 0,1 0 1 3 Using non-determinism, give an alternative proof of the fact that the union of two regular lan- guages is regular. Given that we already know regular languages to be closed under complemen- tation, explain how this proof directly extends to intersections. 4 Given an NFA over some alphabet Σ, show how to construct an NFA over Σ that accepts the same language, but does not contain any ε-transitions. 5 For a language L over some alphabet Σ, we define its Kleene closure as L∗ = {w1w2 · · · wk | k ≥ 0 and w1, w2, . . . , wk ∈ L}. In other words, L∗ contains all strings obtainable by concatenating some (not necessarily distinct) strings from L. Note in particular that ε ∈ L∗ and L ⊂ L∗, corresponding to k = 0, 1. Prove that if L is regular then L∗ is also regular. Page 1 (of 2) CS-251 Theory of Computation • Spring 2025 6* Given a language L over Σ = {0, 1}, define L11 = {xy | x11y ∈ L}. In other words, L11 is the language of all strings obtainable by taking some string in L and deleting two consecutive 1s from it. Prove that if L is regular, then L11 is also regular. Hint: Addtransitionsthatsimulateskippingovertwo1s.Ensureexactlyoneofthemisused. 7* For two strings a, b ∈ Σ of equal length, their Hamming distance, denoted by H(a, b), is the number of indices at which a and b differ. Given a language L over alphabet Σ, define Γ(L) = {w | there is some w′ ∈ L with |w′| = |w| and H(w, w′) ≤ 1}. Prove that if L is regular, then Γ(L) is also regular. Hint: Addtransitionsthatsimulateawronginputsymbol.Ensureatmostoneofthemisused. 8 In lectures, we have seen that if L is regular, then so is its complement L. This was done by taking a DFA that recognises L and changing accepting states for non-accepting states and vice versa. Could we do the same with an NFA that recognises L instead? Explain your answer.
