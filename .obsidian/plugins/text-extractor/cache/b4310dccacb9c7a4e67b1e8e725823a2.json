Solve as many problems as you can and ask for help if you get stuck for too long. These problems are taken from various sources at EPFL and on the Internet, too numer- ous to cite individually. More Problems on Complexity Classes 1 Define coNP = {L : L ∈ NP} as the class of languages whose complements are in NP. Show that if any NP-complete problem lies in coNP, then NP = coNP. 2 Denote by RE the class of recognisable languages. We say that a language L is RE-complete iff L ∈ RE and for every L′ ∈ RE we have L′ ≤m L. Show that HALT is RE-complete. Problems on Circuit Complexity 3 Complete the proof of Circuit-SAT ≤p SAT from the lecture by finding an equivalent CNF formula for each of the three logical predicates y ↔ (x ∨ z), y ↔ (x ∧ z) and y ↔ ¬x. 4 The function Xorn : {0, 1}n → {0, 1} outputs 1 iff the number of 1-bits in the input is odd. Show that Xorn can be computed with a boolean circuit (gates ∨, ∧, ¬) of size O(n). Hint: Constructacircuitforn=2andthenusemanycopiesofthatcircuitforgeneraln. 5 Let φ be any DNF formula over n variables that computes Xorn. Recall that φ = T1 ∨ · · · ∨ Tm where each Tj is a term, that is, a conjunction of literals. 5a* Show that any term Tj either contains n distinct variables or is contradictory, meaning that it contains xi and xi for some variable xi. Hint: UsethefactthatthevalueofXornisflippedifweflipthevalueofanyxi. 5b Thus, show that φ contains at least 2n−1 terms. Note that problems 3–4 together imply that circuits can be much more expressive than CNFs. Page 1 (of 1) CS-251 Theory of Computation • Spring 2025","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
