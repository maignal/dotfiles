Solve as many problems as you can and ask for help if you get stuck for too long. Problems marked * are more difficult but also more fun :). These problems are taken from various sources at EPFL and on the Internet, too numer- ous to cite individually. 1 A k-CNF formula is a CNF formula where each clause has at most k literals. The language kSAT consists of all k-CNF formulas which are satisfiable. What is wrong with the following proof of NP-completeness of 2SAT? Since 3SAT is in NP, so is 2SAT. For any 2-CNF φ = (a1 ∨ b1) ∧ · · · ∧ (an ∨ bn), define the 3-CNF f (φ) = (a1 ∨ b1 ∨ b1) ∧ · · · ∧ (an ∨ bn ∨ bn), where the ai and bi are literals. Note that φ is satisfiable ⇐⇒ f (φ) is satisfiable. Hence 3SAT ≤P 2SAT, and it follows that 2SAT is NP-complete. 2 Prove that the following problem is NP-complete: Given a set S, a collection C of subsets of S and an integer k, is there a subset T ⊆ S of size at most k such that T ∩ C ̸= ∅ for all C ∈ C? 3 Using the NP-completeness SubsetSum, prove that the following problem is NP-complete: Given integers V, v1, . . . , vn and W, w1, . . . , wn, is there a subset S of {1, 2, . . . , n} such that ∑ i∈S wi ≤ W and ∑ i∈S vi ≥ V ? 4* Prove that the following problem is NP-hard: Given vectors v1, . . . , vm, V ∈ Zn and K ∈ Z, do there exist a1, . . . , am ∈ Z such that ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ m∑ i=1 aivi − V ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 ≤ K? Note that for a vector v ∈ Rn, we have ∥v∥2 = ∑n i=1 v2 i . Hint: Firstconsiderthevariantoftheproblemwherea1,a2,...,am∈{0,1}.
