{"path":"Exercises/ToC ex 3.pdf","text":"Exercise III, Theory of Computation 2025 These exercises are for your own benefit. Feel free to collaborate and share your answers with other students. Solve as many problems as you can and ask for help if you get stuck for too long. Problems marked * are more difficult but also more fun :). These problems are taken from various sources at EPFL and on the Internet, too numer- ous to cite individually. 1 Prove that the language L = {0n21n | n ≥ 0} is not regular. 2 Prove that the language L = {0n1m | 0 ≤ n ≤ m OR 0 ≤ 2m ≤ n} is not regular. 3 Let L be language over the singleton alphabet {1} consisting of all the strings whose lengths are prime numbers. Thus, L = {11, 111, 11111, 1111111, . . .}. Prove that L is not regular. 4 A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. Let L be the language over the alphabet {0, 1} consisting of all the palindromes. For example, we have 00 ∈ L, 10101 ∈ L and ε ∈ L. Prove that L is not regular. 5 For any string w over the alphabet {0, 1}, define it’s balance by bal(w) = (number of 1s in w) − (number of 0s in w). 5a For some language L over the alphabet {0, 1}, define BL = {w ∈ {0, 1} ∗ | bal(w) = bal(u) for some u ∈ L}. If L is regular, must BL be regular as well? What about the other direction? 5b* Is the following language regular? L = {w ∈ {0, 1}∗ | −5 ≤ bal(s) ≤ 5 for every substring s of w} Hint: Keeptrackoftheextremalvaluesofbalforsubstringsendingatthecurrentposition. 6* Let L be a language that satisfies the condition of the pumping lemma. Must L be regular? Hint: Modifythepumpinglemmatolookatthebackofthestringinsteadofthefront. Page 1 (of 1) CS-251 Theory of Computation • Spring 2025","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
