{"path":"Exercises/ToC ex 6.pdf","text":"Exercise VI, Theory of Computation 2025 These exercises are for your own benefit. Feel free to collaborate and share your answers with other students. Solve as many problems as you can and ask for help if you get stuck for too long. Problems marked * are more difficult but also more fun :). These problems are taken from various sources at EPFL and on the Internet, too numer- ous to cite individually. 1 Let A1 and A2 be languages with A1 ≤m A2. Is it necessarily true that A1 ≤m A2? 2 Classify each of the following languages into one of the following three categories: decidable, undecidable but recognizable, unrecognizable Justify your answers with proofs (try reductions). 2a L1 = {⟨M ⟩ : M is a Turing machine that halts on all inputs of length at most 2025 } 2b* L2 = {⟨M ⟩ : M is a Turing machine that halts on all inputs of length at least 2025 } 2c L3 = {⟨M ⟩ : M is a Turing machine that accepts some string with more zeros than ones} 3 Let A and B be languages. Prove that if all of A ∩ B, A and B are Turing recognisable, then A ∩ B is Turing decidable. 4* Consider the language L = { ⟨M ⟩ : M is a Turing machine and ∃k ∈ N : M accepts every string of length ≥ k} . Prove that L is unrecognizable. Page 1 (of 1) CS-251 Theory of Computation • Spring 2025","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
