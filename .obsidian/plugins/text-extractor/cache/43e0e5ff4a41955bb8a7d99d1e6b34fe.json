Good luck! Name: N◦ Sciper: Problem 1 Problem 2 Problem 3 Problem 4 / 7 points / 6 points / 6 points / 6 points Total / 25 Page 1 (of 5) CS-251 Theory of Computation, Exam II • Spring 2019 1 (consisting of subproblems a-b, 7 pts) Basic questions. 1a (4 pts) Consider two languages A and B. Which of the following statements are true? 1. A is regular =⇒ A is decidable =⇒ A is recognizable. 2. A and B are decidable =⇒ A ∪ B is decidable. 3. A and B are unrecognizable =⇒ A ∪ B is unrecognizable. 4. A is undecidable and recognizable =⇒ A is unrecognizable. 5. A is decidable =⇒ A is decidable. 6. {0n1n : n ≥ 0} is decidable. 7. A is decidable and A ≤m B =⇒ B decidable. 8. {⟨M, w⟩ | M is a TM and M doesn’t halt on input w} is recognizable. (A complete solution identiﬁes all true statements. A fully correct solution is worth 4 points. A solution with one mistake is worth 3 points. A solution with two mistakes is worth 1 point. Solutions with more mistakes are worth 0 points. A mistake is to either indicate falsely that a false statement is true or to not indicate that a true statement is true.) Page 2 (of 5) CS-251 Theory of Computation, Exam II • Spring 2019 1b (3 pts) Let B be an undecidable language. Show that B ≤m B implies that B and B are unrecognizable. (In this problem you are asked to provide a formal proof of the statement. Recall that you are allowed to refer to material covered in the class including theorems without reproving them.) Page 3 (of 5) CS-251 Theory of Computation, Exam II • Spring 2019 2 (6 pts) A DFA D = (Q, Σ ,δ, q, F ) is deﬁned to be minimal if it has the minimum number of states among all DFAs that recognize the same language as D. More formally, D is minimal if |Q| = min D′=(Q′,Σ,δ′,q′,F ′): L(D)=L(D′) |Q′|. Show that the following language is decidable. L2 = {⟨D⟩ | D is a minimal DFA} . (In this problem you are asked to show that the language L2 is decidable. Recall that you are allowed to refer to material covered in the class including theorems without reproving them.) Page 4 (of 5) CS-251 Theory of Computation, Exam II • Spring 2019 3 (6 pts) Consider the following language L3 = {⟨M ⟩ | M is a TM that halts on every input} . Show that L3 is unrecognizable by giving a mapping reduction from the unrecognizable language N R deﬁned as follows: N R = {⟨M, w⟩ | M is a TM and M does not reject input w} . In other words, show that N R ≤m L3. (In this problem you are asked to give a mapping reduction from the language N R to the language L3 and to provide a formal proof of its correctness. A mapping reduction from another unrecognizable language, such as AT M , only gives partial points. You are not required to prove that L3 and N R are unrecognizable. Recall that you are allowed to refer to material covered in the class including theorems without reproving them.) 4 (6 pts) Classify the following language into one of: decidable, undecidable but recognizable, unrecognizable. L4 = {⟨M, D⟩ | M is a TM, D is a DFA and L(D) ∩ L(M ) ̸= φ} . Justify your answer with a formal proof. (In this problem, you are asked to identify whether L4 is (decidable and recognizable), (unde- cidable and recognizable), or (unrecognizable) and provide a formal correctness proof. Recall that you are allowed to refer to material covered in the class including theorems without reproving them.)
